These are the install versions used with my app:
Expo CLI version 5.30 (expo --version)
react-native-cli: 2.0.1 (react-native --version)
react-native: 0.64.3 (react-native --version)

To run app:
1. Enter the RecipeApp folder via the Command Line 
2. Enter the command 'npm start'
3a. Scan the QR code with an Android or iOS device
OR
3b. You can run this via an emulator (android studio should work for android)

Note: 
In the search area, there are meals which begin with the letter 'C'
This is intentional
I obtained the recipes via themealDB API and figured for this scenario, it would be better
to just get a sample of recipes rather than all the meals from the mealDB API

I have added screenshots to show what the app should look like

I tested the app primarily on an iPhone XR and a Google Pixel 3a (emulated)
